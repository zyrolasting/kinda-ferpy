Kinda Ferpy is a restricted, yet convenient interface for functional reactive programming.
Signals/events and dependency relationships are implicit in how you write code, making
certain kinds of work super convenient and nice.

```
(require kinda-ferpy)

(define x (stateful-cell 1))
(define y (stateful-cell 1))
(define sum (stateful-cell (Î» _ (+ (x) (y)))))

(displayln (sum)) ; 2
(y 8)
(displayln (sum)) ; 9
```

The implementation model is based on @MaiaVictor's [PureState][] library.
